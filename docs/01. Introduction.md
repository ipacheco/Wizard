# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of Wizard module!

In this part, the following questions will be answered:

* Why should I use wizards?
* Why should I use this module?

## Why should I use wizards?

There are many situations when creating forms, that either you cannot accept all data on one page, either because certain responses result in a different set of subsequent questions, or because you form is so long that you need to split it up into multiple pages. Sometimes, you also need to show confirmation of the form data prior to processing the data.

## Why should I use this module?

The module allows you to separate your code into different stages which the sequence will be handled automatically.
