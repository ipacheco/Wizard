# Quick Start

In this section, you will learn:

* How to setup the module
* How to create a wizard
* How to specify redirection after successful wizard or cancellation
* How to add steps

Before starting the quick start, make sure you have properly installed the module by following the instructions in
the README file.

## Creating a wizard

This configuration creates a wizard called "wizard-foo" without any steps yet.

```php
<?php
return array(
    'wizard' => array(
        'wizards' => array(
            'wizard-foo' => array(

            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```

## Specifying redirect urls

This configuration specifies routes use to redirect after successful wizard processing or cancellation.

```php
<?php
return array(
    'wizard' => array(
        'wizards' => array(
            'wizard-foo' => array(
                'redirect_url'    => '/foo',
                'cancel_url'      => '/bar',
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```

## Adding steps

A wizard may contain as many steps as you want. For instance, this configuration
add a step:

```php
<?php
return array(
    'wizard' => array(
        'wizards' => array(
            'wizard-foo' => array(
                'redirect_url'    => '/foo',
                'cancel_url'      => '/bar',
                'steps' => array(
                    'Namespace\Wizard\Step\FooStep' => array(
                        'title'         => 'foo',
                        'view_template' => 'wizard/foo',
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ),
    'wizard_steps' => array(
        'factories' => array(
            'Namespace\Wizard\Step\FooStep' => function($sm) {
                $step = new \Namespace\Wizard\Step\FooStep();

                $formManager = $sm->get('FormElementManager');
                $form = $formManager->get('Namespace\Wizard\Step\FooStepForm');
                step->setForm($form);

                return $step;
            },
        ),
    ),
    'form_elements' => array(
        'invokables' => array(
            'Namespace\Wizard\Step\FooStepForm' => 'Namespace\Wizard\Step\FooStepForm',
        ),
    ),
);
```

Each step is configured by specifying a title and defining a view template that will be used to rendering. A class extending `Wizard\AbstractStep` is created and declared as a service in "wizard_steps" array that corresponds to the service manager dedicated to steps. In the factory that allows the creation of the step, a form instance is injected into the instance.
